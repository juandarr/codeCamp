# CodeCamp review lessons

For this project I will  be following the lessons from the site freecodecamp.org. This site provides tutorials to jumpstart a career in web development. My intention here is to review the material and dig deeper in topics I care about such as web design and JS frameworks (Vue is one I want to learn about!).
